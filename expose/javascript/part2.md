12. A. student.name
    B. student["Grad Year"]
    C. student.greeting()

13. A. '32' because integers map to their exact string representation.
    B. 1 because the string '3' maps to the integer 3.
    C. 3 because null maps to 0.
    D. '3null' because null maps to the string 'null'.
    E. 4 because true maps to 1.
    F. 0 because false and null map to 0.
    G. '3undefined' because undefined maps to the string 'undefined'.
    H. NaN because undefined maps to NaN.
14. A. true because '2' maps to the integer 2.
    B. false because '2' and '12' are strings and when comparing strings the first character is compared and '2' is greater than '1'.
    C. true because '2' maps to the integer 2.
    D. false because === is a strict equality operator and the types of 2 and '2' are different.
    E. false because true maps to 1 and 1 is not equal to 2.
    F. true because Boolean(2) maps to true.
15. == is a loose equality operator and === is a strict equality operator. == will convert the operands to the same type before comparing them while === will not convert the operands to the same type before comparing them.
